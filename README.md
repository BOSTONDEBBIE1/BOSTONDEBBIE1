Hello, I'm working on something special.  I wanted to play my Android games on my computer.  I used blue stacks and it is awesome. I'm still having a bit of trouble. I even reset my computer and it didn't reset right my profile shows up as a temp. I can't seem to sign in or and it won't save anything I do.  Please tell me what to do..
